# simulated-craft-neuralnet
Controlling simulated spacecraft with genetic algorithm &amp; neural network

This project was created in collaboration with Louis Lebouef.

If you wish to build this project, you will need:
- base python libraries
- pygame

# What is this project?
This project provides:
- Multiple simlulated craft, each with their own unique control schemes (two bidirectional thrusters, single gimbaled thrust, dual gimbaled thrusters, etc.)
- Neural network and genetic algorithm training modules
- Ability to train the neural networks to fly these craft to their 'goal destinations'
- A realtime visualization module to view both the craft and the activity of the neural network
